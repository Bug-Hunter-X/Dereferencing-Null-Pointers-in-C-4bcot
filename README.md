This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the potential issue of dereferencing a null pointer. The program attempts to dereference a pointer without ensuring that it points to a valid memory location.  This can lead to segmentation faults or other unpredictable behavior. The solution shows how to address this problem by adding a check before the dereference operation.
